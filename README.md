# Civ Clicker

This is a fork of the open source game CivClicker, an incremental game by David Holley and Scott A. Colcord. It was improved by Luke Nickerson. My goal is to not make massive changes, rather to just make it available for Android.

## Try it out

* Play the latest stable version: http://deathraygames.com/play-online/civ-clicker/ (at least somewhat stable)
* Play the cutting edge, unstable development code directly from the GitHub repo: https://deathraygames.github.io/civ-clicker/ (could have bugs or half-baked features)
* Play the original v1.0: http://dhmholley.co.uk/civclicker.html
